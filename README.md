👋 Hi, I’m @Gaurang-Sharma
👀 I'm passionate about exploring the latest trends in technology, particularly in the realms of Data Science and machine learning. I enjoy diving deep into Python frameworks like Flask and Django, and I'm fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and data science to transform industries and everyday life.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
At the moment, I'm focusing on enhancing my skills in full-stack development, specifically in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack as well as honing my skills in AWS. I'm also expanding my knowledge in data analysis and visualization using tools like Python's Pandas and Matplotlib. Additionally, I'm exploring cloud technologies and DevOps practices to streamline the development and deployment processes.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
I'm eager to collaborate on open-source projects that aim to make technology more accessible and inclusive. Whether it's building user-friendly web applications, developing machine learning models for social good, or contributing to documentation and tutorials, I'm excited to work with others who share a passion for innovation and community-driven development.

⚡ Fun fact:
Apart from coding, I have a keen interest in Motorsports and often spend my weekends working on my car. I also enjoy hiking and have explored some of the most scenic trails in my region. Fun fact: I once coded an update in my car's ECU to update the fuel mappings!
